# Anonymize Fixtures and Doc Examples

This is a **public, open-source repository**. Test fixtures, the rule
`CodeSample` heredocs in `src/`, and the snippets in `README.md` / `docs/` are
all world-readable on GitHub — and `src/` plus the README also ship in the
Composer dist archive. `/tests` is `export-ignore`d, but that only trims the
archive; it hides nothing on GitHub. Doc examples are the easy thing to forget
precisely because they are not "fixtures" — they leak just the same.

Every example — fixture, `CodeSample`, or doc snippet — must be **synthetic**.
Never copy proprietary application code — from hihaho or any
consumer/dogfooding codebase — into one. Reconstruct the smallest generic
example that demonstrates the rule, then strip every domain detail not needed
to make the point.

This keeps internal domain models, naming, business terms, and logic out of a
public artifact, and it makes for better examples: the transformation stands
out instead of being buried in incidental domain noise.

## Anonymize these

- **Class and namespace names** — use framework-conventional placeholders
  (`App\Models\Article`, `App\Http\Resources\PostResource`). Don't reach for
  the product's real domain entities.
- **Variable, property, and method names** that carry domain meaning.
- **String literals** — route paths, table and column names, config keys,
  labels, messages. Invent neutral values; never paste a real schema column
  or route key.
- **Business terminology and comments** lifted from real code.
- **Logic and control flow** that mirrors a real implementation.

## Keep these — they are not leaks

- **Framework and vendor public symbols** (`Illuminate\…`, `Route`,
  `Blueprint`, `JsonResource`, `Model`). The rule usually has to match these
  to fire, and they are public API.
- **Generic example nouns** — `User`, `Post`, `Order`, `Article`, `Comment`.
- **The convention the rule enforces** (suffixes, alias targets, flag-column
  names). That is the package's public contract, not proprietary.

## Rule of thumb

An example should read like a generic framework tutorial snippet, not like a
slice of one company's application. If a reader could tell which product it
came from, anonymize further — prefer a neutral noun (`Article`, `Order`) over
an actual product entity (e.g. `Video`, `caliper`, `adaptiveLearning`).

## When adding or editing a fixture or doc example

1. Keep only the framework symbols the rule matches against.
2. Replace real names and strings with neutral equivalents.
3. For a fixture, run the test to confirm the rule still fires
   (`vendor/bin/pest path/to/RuleTest.php`); for a `CodeSample` or README
   snippet, keep it consistent with the rule it documents.
4. Before committing, scan the diff for product names, real table/column
   names, and domain jargon — across `README.md` and `docs/` too, not only
   `tests/` and `src/`.

## Fixing PHPStan Errors

When fixing a PHPStan error, first decide whether it represents a runtime bug a test could catch — and if so, write that test before the fix.

### Process

1. **Assess testability** — does the error represent a runtime bug a test could reproduce (a wrong argument type, a missing method, an incorrect return type used downstream)?
2. **Write the test first** — if a test can catch it, write a failing test that reproduces the error before applying the fix.
3. **Fix the code** — apply the fix so both the PHPStan error and the new test pass.
4. **Verify both** — confirm PHPStan reports no error and the test passes.

### When to Write a Test

Write a test when the PHPStan error indicates a fault that would surface at runtime:

- A method call on a value of the wrong type
- Missing or incorrect arguments to a function or method
- A return-type mismatch that would break callers
- Accessing a property or method that does not exist
- Any type error that would manifest as a runtime exception

### When to Skip the Test

Skip the test when the error is purely static and cannot cause a runtime failure:

- Missing return-type declarations
- PHPDoc mismatches with no runtime impact
- Unused variables or imports
- Generic-type parameter issues

---

## Signed Commits

Applies **only when the repository has commit signing enabled** (e.g. `git config commit.gpgsign` is `true`, or a `user.signingkey` / `gpg.format` is set). If signing is not enabled, this guideline does not apply — commit normally.

### Never fall back to an unsigned commit

When signing is enabled, every commit must be signed. If the signing backend or agent (1Password, `gpg-agent`, `ssh-agent`, a hardware key, etc.) is unavailable, locked, or not responding:

- **Stop and surface the failure** to the user with the exact error.
- **Do not** retry with `--no-gpg-sign`, unset `commit.gpgsign`, or otherwise produce an unsigned commit to "get past" the problem.

A missing signature is a blocker to resolve (unlock the agent, re-authenticate 1Password, plug in the key), not a step to skip. Let the user fix the signing setup, then commit signed.

## Verification Before Completion

Before claiming any work is complete or successful, run the verification command fresh and confirm the output. Evidence before claims, always.

### Required Before Any Completion Claim

1. **Run** the relevant command (in the current message, not from memory)
2. **Read** the full output
3. **Confirm** it supports the claim
4. **Then** state the result with evidence

| Claim            | Required verification                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tests pass       | The project's test command, output showing 0 failures            |
| Code style clean | The project's formatter/style checker, output showing no changes |
| Linting clean    | The project's linter, output showing 0 errors                    |
| Types check      | The project's type checker, output showing 0 errors              |
| Bug fixed        | The previously failing test now passes                           |
| Feature complete | All related tests pass                                           |

Use the project's own commands — check its `composer.json` / `package.json` scripts, CI config, or sibling docs to find them. Do not assume a specific tool.

### Delegating the checks

Where the project has dedicated quality-check skills synced, delegate to them — `backend-quality` for backend files, `frontend-quality` for frontend files, both when a change spans both. Otherwise, run the project's own equivalent commands directly.

### Never Use Without Evidence

- "should work now"
- "that should fix it"
- "looks correct"
- "I'm confident this works"

These phrases indicate missing verification. Run the command first, then report what actually happened.

# Laravel Package Guidelines

These guidelines supplement the framework-agnostic Package Boost
Guidelines (`foundation.md`) for Composer packages that target
Laravel. A consumer receives both files, composed — read this one
together with `foundation.md`, not instead of it.

Apply this file only when `composer.json` declares a Laravel
dependency — a `require.illuminate/*` entry or
`require.laravel/framework`. A framework-agnostic package ignores
everything below.

## Laravel Context

A Laravel package has no host application of its own. A Laravel
kernel is booted only at test time, by Orchestra Testbench. The base
test case is `Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase`.

- `composer.json`'s `require.illuminate/*` (or
  `require.laravel/framework`) defines the supported Laravel range.
  Check it before using a version-specific framework API.
- The service provider is the package's entry point into a host
  app. One per package, named `{PackageStudly}ServiceProvider`,
  registered under `extra.laravel.providers` for package discovery.
- Test fixtures — migrations, routes, views, factories — live under
  `workbench/`, not `tests/`. Testbench's conventions place them
  there; follow them.

## Use `vendor/bin/testbench`, not `php artisan`

Running artisan directly against the package fails — there is no
host application. Use Testbench's binary, which boots a kernel
first:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `php artisan test` | `vendor/bin/pest` or `vendor/bin/phpunit` |
| `php artisan tinker` | `vendor/bin/testbench tinker` |
| `php artisan make:*` | Create files manually under `src/` |
| `php artisan vendor:publish` | `vendor/bin/testbench vendor:publish` |

Register the package's service provider in `testbench.yaml` under
`providers:` so Testbench boots it. Published files land in
`workbench/` by default, not the `config/` or `resources/` of a
host app.

### Commands that require `laravel/boost`

These apply only when the package has `laravel/boost` as a dev
dependency. Skip them if Boost is not installed — `boost sync`
prints a warning and moves on.

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `php artisan boost:install` | `vendor/bin/testbench boost:install` |
| `php artisan boost:mcp` | `vendor/bin/testbench boost:mcp` |

## Cross-Version Compatibility

Supporting multiple Laravel and PHP majors in one release is routine
for a Laravel package. Constraints use `||` between major ranges
(`^12.0||^13.0`), and CI runs a matrix that includes `prefer-lowest`
so the declared floor is actually exercised.

- Activate the `cross-version-laravel-support` skill **before**
  writing version-spanning code.
- Activate the `ci-matrix-troubleshooting` skill **after** a matrix
  cell has failed.
- See the `package-development` skill for the Testbench and
  `workbench/` layout.

# Package Boost Guidelines

These guidelines replace Laravel Boost's default foundation for
repositories that ship as Composer packages — Laravel-targeted or
framework-agnostic. The framing, tooling, and trade-offs differ from
application development; follow this version when working inside a
package codebase.

## Foundational Context

This codebase is a **Composer package**, not an application. The rules
below hold regardless of which framework (if any) the package targets.

- There is no `app/`, `bootstrap/`, `routes/`, `.env`, or database by
  default. Tooling that assumes an application context (e.g. running
  `php artisan` against the package itself) does not apply.
- The primary artefact is the package's public API — entry-point
  classes, service providers, exposed contracts. Everything else is
  scaffolding.
- Downstream consumers depend on this package via Composer. Every
  public change is a user-facing API change governed by semver.
- `composer.json` is the source of truth for supported PHP versions
  and any framework constraints. Check `require.php` (and any
  `require.<framework>/*` entries) before using version-specific
  features.

## Source Layout

- `src/` — package source, PSR-4 autoloaded per `composer.json`
- `tests/` — Pest or PHPUnit suite
- `config/` — publishable defaults shipped with the package, when
  applicable
- `resources/` — views, translations, Boost skills / guidelines, when
  applicable
- `database/migrations`, `database/factories` — only if the package
  ships them
- `workbench/` — developer-only Testbench scaffolding when Testbench
  is in use; never shipped

Check sibling files before inventing structure. Do not introduce new
top-level directories without a clear reason.

## Tests Are the Specification

The package has no running application to click through. Tests are how
behaviour is pinned down.

- Write tests alongside any behavioural change.
- Do not create "verification scripts" when a test can prove the same
  thing.
- Run the project's configured test runner (`vendor/bin/pest` or
  `vendor/bin/phpunit`) before claiming a change is done.

## Public API Discipline

- Every `public`, `protected`, or exported symbol is part of the
  package's surface. Breaking changes require a major version bump.
- Prefer `final` classes and `private`/`@internal` markers for
  anything not intended for extension.
- Keep config keys, published asset paths, and service container
  bindings stable across patch and minor versions.

## Conventions

- Match existing code style, naming, and structural patterns — check
  sibling files before writing new ones.
- Use descriptive names (`resolvePublishDestination`, not `resolve()`).
- Reuse existing helpers before adding new ones.
- Do not add dependencies without approval; every new `require` is a
  constraint downstream consumers inherit.

## Extending boost-core

If your package authors a custom `FileEmitter` (to write a file like
`.mcp.json` into the host during `boost sync`), declare the
`boost-extension` tag in your `boost.php` `withTags([...])`. That pulls
the `writing-file-emitter` skill — gated off by default so consumers
who do not extend the engine don't carry it, which is why an
emitter-authoring package has to opt in explicitly. The same tag pulls
`skill-authoring` for writing boost-family skills.

## Documentation Files

Only create or edit documentation (README, CHANGELOG, docs/) when
explicitly requested or when a behaviour change requires it.

## Replies

Be concise. Focus on what changed and why. Skip restating what the
diff already shows.

---

# Release Automation

Conventions the package-boost family shares for release flow. The
procedural detail lives in the `pre-release` and `release-notes`
skills — loaded on-demand, not pinned here.

## CHANGELOG is CI-managed

`.github/workflows/update-changelog.yml` prepends the release body to
`CHANGELOG.md` on `release: released` and commits to the release's
target branch (typically `main`). Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` as
part of a release. Post-release typo fixes are committed directly.

## Release notes live in `internal/release-notes-<version>.md`

`internal/` is gitignored — drafts stay local. The notes file becomes
the release body. The first line pins the green commit so the pre-tag
gate can fail closed on drift:

```
<!-- verified-sha: <full sha> -->
```

## Tag and title

- Tag: bare version (`0.7.0`) — Composer and Packagist read the tag.
- Release title: `v`-prefixed (`v0.7.0`) — cosmetic.
- Notes file: bare (`internal/release-notes-0.7.0.md`).

## Agent handoff

Agents stop at the ready-to-tag handoff. The user runs the pre-tag
gate and publishes the release (GitHub UI, `gh`, or otherwise). See
the `pre-release` skill for the full procedure and the no-release-create
rule.
